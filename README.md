Davenant and Drysden's "The Tempest" was a hugely popular adaptation of Shakespeare's original work. This also had the benefit of allowing new audiences to interact and enjoy the work especially due to the blooming nature of theatre and their productions at this time.

Samuel Pepys' diary features several entries detailing trips that he enjoyed not only was he frequently attending the productions but he records the enjoyment of the crowd at each subsequent performances, over the course of 18-20 months. This showed the vibrant health of the cultural side of London during the period, with the longevity of productions indicating a popularity with audience and manuscripts of the plays, surviving that although modern adaptations have been made. The contiuned popularity and the human element that clearly resonates with a wide audience remains unchanged despite modern changes. This has a parity with today where in a modernising and changing world the presentaton alters but the content that draws and interest and creates unity remains at its core largely unchanged.

## Map

The opposing theatre troupes within London were often in competition with each other, and so productions and the source material was jealously guarded with the popular productions being particularly in demand. This meant that skilled playwrights, who were often actors first, could ensure the fortune and success of their fellow performers. Indeed many productions ere written with the active troupe member refernced as their character in the initial 'scripts' or the characters name is replaced almost synonymously.
